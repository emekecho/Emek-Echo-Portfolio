<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a UX/UI designer and an Audio Engineer. OMW to be a Vegan Coder with the guidance of Angela Yu.</p>

<p>I'm super creative and bold enough to explore new ways to resolve design and audio problems.</p>

<p>Depending on the project, I go head in or take my time to get everything right before I give you the best outcome that will make you smile for a while.</p>
